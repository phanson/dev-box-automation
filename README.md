This is a collection of shell scripts and Puppet manifests
used to set up a development machines under Linux,
specifically Xubuntu (16.04.1 at time of writing).

I got tired of forgetting super useful utilities that were
installed on my last dev box but got left behind when
upgrading hardware, so I made this.

Probably nothing here is useful to you. That being said,
help yourself to anything you like.
