This is a collection of shell scripts and Puppet manifests
used to set up a new development machine under Linux,
specifically Ubuntu (13.10 at time of writing).

Basically, I got tired of forgetting super useful utilities
that were installed on my last dev box and didn't get
installed on my new dev box, so I made this.

Standard personal repo disclaimers apply: idiosyncratic,
not ready for production, probably not directly applicable
to your needs, etc. That being said, help yourself to
anything useful.
